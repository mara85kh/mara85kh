### Hi there, I'm Mara 👋.  I'm a web developer in training based in Namur, Belgium

---

I've started my career in 2010 with the launching of Kinect for XBOX 360 at Microsoft Belgium & Luxembourg.  It was a fun ride and an amazing experience that led me to be Executive Assistant for the Senior Leadership Team. Then my curiosity led me to pursue a career at an European Lobby as an Office Manager.  Around my 30's I decided to travel a bit and ended up dancing the Samba at the heart of the action that is the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro.  Then I got a training in Logistics lending me jobs as a Manager and I decided to pursue my education by learning the basics of Web Development at a later age. I am enthusiastic about solving issues out of the box and passionate when it's time to learn new stuff and meet new people to share bright ideas.
